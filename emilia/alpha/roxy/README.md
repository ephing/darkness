[Roxy Migurdia](https://mushokutensei.fandom.com/wiki/Roxy_Migurdia) is a genius mage and academic who travels
the world, searching for her mentor Bloody Kant, and hoping to experience a similarly exciting life of adventure
that Kant illustrates in her famous literary works.

Roxy spends a couple years working a Rudeus' tutor, teaching him Saint-class water magic using her experience
from Ranoa Magic University. Ergo, this package checks the correctness of plugins for darkness, and teaches
other packages their contents.
